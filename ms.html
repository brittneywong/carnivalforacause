        <h2>Learn about Multiple Sclerosis</h2>

        <h3>What is Multiple Sclerosis?</h3>
        <p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an unpredictable, often disabling disease of the central nervous system that disrupts the flow of information within the brain, and between the brain and body.</p>
        <h3>What are the symptoms?</h3>
        <p>MS symptoms are variable and unpredictable. No two people have exactly the same symptoms, and each person’s symptoms can change or fluctuate over time. One person might experience only one or two of the possible symptoms while another person experiences many more. Symptoms include fatigue, numbness or tingling, dizzingess and vertigo, cognitive changes, depression, vision problems, and walking difficulties.</p>
        <h3>Treating Multiple Sclerosis</h3>
        <p>Managing MS is an ongoing process, beginning with the very first symptoms and continuing throughout the disease course. It’s never too soon or too late to think about how to access high quality, comprehensive, interdisciplinary care. Knowing what to look for, where to find it, and how to work effectively with your doctor and other health professionals is essential to your health, wellness and quality of life.</p>
